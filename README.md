  This project focuses on analyzing Netflix's Movies and TV Shows dataset using Structured Query Language (SQL). The goal is to extract meaningful insights related to content trends, genres, actors, countries, and release patterns.

The dataset includes metadata such as title, director, cast, country, release year, duration, genre (category), and date added. By applying SQL queries, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer business questions and discover patterns in Netflix's content catalog.

# 🎯 Objectives
  1. Analyze the distribution of movies and TV shows across years and countries.
  2. Identify the most frequent genres, directors, and actors.
  3. Evaluate content trends by year, country, and type.
  4. Derive insights into release timing, content duration, and content growth over time.
  5. Enhance SQL query writing and optimization skills.

# 🧠 Skills Used
1. SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
2. Data Cleaning & Transformation
3. JSON Functions (JSON_TABLE, COALESCE, REPLACE, TRIM)
4 .Aggregation, Grouping, Filtering
5 .Date and String Functions
